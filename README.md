## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account and a new project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  In your project, go to **Authentication** -> **Sign-in method** and enable **Email/Password** and **Google** providers.
3.  Go to **Firestore Database** and create a new database in **Production mode**.
4.  In Firestore, create the following collections:
    - `users`
    - `serviceBookings`
    - `contactSubmissions`
5.  Navigate to **Project Settings** (click the gear icon) -> **General**. Under "Your apps", create a new **Web app**.
6.  Copy the `firebaseConfig` object. You will need these keys for the next step.

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Firebase configuration keys.

```plaintext
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID
```


    // --- Service Bookings Collection ---
    match /serviceBookings/{bookingId} {
      // Anyone authenticated can create a booking
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      // An admin can read any booking
      allow read: if isAdmin();
      // A user can read their own bookings
      allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userEmail == request.auth.token.email;
      // Only an admin can update the status of a booking
      allow update: if isAdmin();
    }

    // --- Contact Submissions Collection ---
    match /contactSubmissions/{submissionId} {
      // Any authenticated user can create a contact submission
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      // Only admins can read contact submissions
      allow read, list: if isAdmin();
    }
  }
}
```
**Important:** Don't forget to update the `adminEmails` list in the rules with your own admin email address. After pasting the rules, click **Publish**.

### 6. Run the Development Server

You can now start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or the port specified in `package.json`) with your browser to see the result.
